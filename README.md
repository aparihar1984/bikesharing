## Overview of the Analysis/Purpose:
Using Pandas, we first changed the "tripduration" column in our original csv file from an integer to a datetime datatype.  After finishing this change to our datasheet, we used the converted datatype to create a set of visualizations that included:

Showing the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
Showing the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
Showing the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

To finish our final presentation and analysis, we added these visualizations to two other visulizations (Top Starting Locations and Top Ending Locations) that were created in the module to pitch to investors.

## Results
A total of 7 visulizations are used for this presentation/analysis.  They are listed along with a quick description for each below.

1)[Tableau.com](https://public.tableau.com/profile/ash.parihar#!/vizhome/Module14Deliverables/CheckoutTimesforUsers).
This visulization represents the "Checkout Times for Users" graph as the graph itself represents the Number of Bikes versus the Minutes.

2)[Tableau.com](https://public.tableau.com/profile/ash.parihar#!/vizhome/Module14Deliverables/CheckoutTimesbyGender).
This visulization represents the "Checkout Times by Gender" graph as the graph itself represents the Number of Bikes versus the Minutes.  Males, females and unknowns are all represented.

3)[Tableau.com](https://public.tableau.com/profile/ash.parihar#!/vizhome/Module14Deliverables/TripsbyWeekdayperHour).
This visulization represents the "Trips by Weekday per Hour" graph as the graph itself represents the Starttime (Hour) versus the Stoptime (Day).

4)[Tableau.com](https://public.tableau.com/profile/ash.parihar#!/vizhome/Module14Deliverables/TripsbyGender).
This visulization represents the "Trips by Gender" graph as the graph itself represents the Starttime (Hour) versus the Stoptime (Day).  Males, females, and unknowns are all represented.

5)[Tableau.com](https://public.tableau.com/profile/ash.parihar#!/vizhome/Module14Deliverables/UserTripsbyGenderbyWeekday).
This visulization represents the "User Trips by Gender by Weekday" graph as the graph itself represents the weekday versus the customer type.  Males, females, and unknowns are all represented.

6)[Tableau.com](https://public.tableau.com/profile/ash.parihar#!/vizhome/Module14Deliverables/TopStartingLocations).
This visulization represents the "Top Starting Locations" map as the map itself represents the starting locations of the riders.

7)[Tableau.com](https://public.tableau.com/profile/ash.parihar#!/vizhome/Module14Deliverables/TopEndingLocations).
This visulization represents the "Top Ending Locations" map as the map itself represents the ending locations of the riders.

## Summary
Two additional visulizations that could be recommended for future presentations include a pie chart that breaks down the number of riders by gender, and a graph plotting the average trip duration that breaks down the average trip duration by the age of the rider.  Breaking down the riders into groups such as age and sex can help us indentify biking data/patterns in a specific location/city.  Using these patterns might allow us to project whether bike-sharing programs can work in different locations.
